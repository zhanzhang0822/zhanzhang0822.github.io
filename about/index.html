  <h1>About Me</h1>

    <div class="br-info"></div>

<p><img src="/images/zz-info-2021.jpg" alt="_config.yml" /></p>

<p>My name is 詹章 / Zhang Zhan, and I am also known as ZZ.</p>

<p>I am currently doing my art and design residency at <a href="http://www.fabrica.it/" target="_blank">Fabrica</a>.</p>

<p>Coming from a creative technologist background, I feed on digital technology but I also long for being surrounded by analog media. My previous works have focused on integrating new media into the music domain and bridging different media with the help of digital fabrication as well as physical computing. I am now in the transition to fine-tuning human-centered experiences through the innovation of artifacts, spaces and services, and creating interactive experiences revolving around contemporary digital cultures and rituals.</p>

<p>I graduated from New York University Shanghai in 2017, majoring in Interactive Media Arts and minoring in Business. My capstone project is <a href="/2017/05/01/exposed-and-interlaced.html" target="_blank">Exposed &amp; Interlaced – Exploring Motion in Analog and Digital</a>. It is a sequence of imaging chronicling a dance performance into 10 different fragments. The viewer is able to view each fragment as a long exposure film print, as a representation of analog means, and an interactive lenticular that allows the viewer to see a short video clip by changing their perspective, as a representation of digital means. The fragments are displayed sequentially to communicate the entire dance performance.</p>

<p>I received my Laurea Magistrale (equivalent to Master of Science) in Digital and Interaction Design at Politecnico di Milano in 2021. My thesis is <a href="/pdfs/zhang-zhan-thesis-polimi-portfolio.pdf" target="_blank">Death Ritual and Mobile Media: An Examination on Existing Attempts</a>, which investigates the existing attempts to mobilize death rituals in selected cultural contexts with relevant sociological theories and user experience design perspectives. The theoretical analysis is followed by a user research featuring a semi-structured interview of fifteen people who recently experienced death of someone they know and participated in mobile media-involved death rituals for insights based on real-life experience with which a benchmarking of the mobile media usage is produced. The thesis work concludes with giving overview of the functionality of various mobile media currently involved in the death rituals, accompanied with personal reflections and indicate possible directions for future endeavors in the field.</p>

<p>I was born in Wuyuan, Jiangxi, known as “the most beautiful countryside” with many scenic old villages in which I spent most of my childhood. I moved to Shanghai with my family when I was about 10 years old and had been living there ever since. I was fortunate enough to become a short-term resident of other three great cities–Prague, New York and Milano. I am now drinking prosecco and Aperol Sprtiz in the city of Treviso, Italia.</p>
