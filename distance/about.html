                <p>There's this quote that I heard of before and to be honest, I don't remember exact words. But it is basically saying no matter how far apart two people are, compared to the distance between earth and moon, it is a lot easier for the two to meet than one of them going to the moon.</p>



                <p>This quote made me think of the common approach that many ancient Chinese poets used to express that they were longing for faraway beloved in their masterpieces. The phase can be summarized as "though we are far apart, both looking at the moon, and it de facto makes us closer to each other".
