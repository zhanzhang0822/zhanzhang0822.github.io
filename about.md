My name is 詹章 / Zhang Zhan. I am currently a senior at NYU Shanghai majoring in Interactive Media Arts with a minor in Business.

Born in Wuyuan and raised in Shanghai, I have lived in other two great cities–Prague and New York–shortly.

My works have focused on integrating new media into the music domain and bridging different media with the help of digital fabrication as well as physical computing. 

I am also a designer specializing in typography and graphic design, and a photographer specializing in film, black and white, still life and documentary photography.
